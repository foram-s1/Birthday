# Birthdays List App with MEAN
This repository contains the code for a RESTful API Birthday List App that was built using the *MEAN* stack:
> - MongoDB 
> - Express
> - AngularJS
> - NodeJS 

This is a sample web-application that can be used to store, create, delete, edit the birthdays along with name, dates and notes. Basically it's a full-fledge working __*CRUD*__ App. 

Once hosted on Heroku:- __*https://birthdays1.herokuapp.com/bdays*__
 
More features are in *progress*.
